## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This **must** be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "id": "recONRzIUTuZ5lXaF",
      "fields": {
        "author": "Liz Yrineo",
        "setup": "Why did the tomato turn red?",
        "punchline": "Because it saw the salad dressing!"
      },
      "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "rec3oYZ5Tp0AIDsKe",
      "fields": {
        "author": "Rachel Moskowitz",
        "setup": "What did the green grape say to the red grape?",
        "punchline": "Breathe, idiot, breathe!"
      },
      "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "recA34tOaoE1IVeC1",
      "fields": {
        "author": "Gary Grant",
        "setup": "How do you make holy water?",
        "punchline": "You boil the hell out of it!"
      },
      "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "offset": "recA34tOaoE1IVeC1"
}
```

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP. Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP
-Able to add new product with images
-Edit product
 -Delete product.
### On the the front end, customer/user will be able to do the following:
1 View list of product in the store
#### PostMVP

_These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features._

- Add authenticaton
- add stripe payment

| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| July 10-12 | Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete |
| July 13    | Project Approval                                   | Incomplete |

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all parts of your app. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component        | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ---------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Adding Form      |    H     |      3hrs      |    3.5hrs     |   3.5hrs    |
| Working with API |    H     |      3hrs      |    2.5hrs     |   2.5hrs    |
| Total            |    H     |      6hrs      |     5hrs      |    5hrs     |
